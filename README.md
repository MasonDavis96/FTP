# FTP
A tool that was created to assist our local Records Department in transferring files over to an FTP server through an executable.

I navigate to the specified directory, zip the files, and send them to the specified FTP Server. 
After succesfully sending the zip folder, the original files in the directory are deleted so the users do not have to maintain the directory structure.

This powershell script was turned into an executable, so the users only need to double click the icon that was placed on their desktop and the work is done for them.
